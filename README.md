# binaryImageClassification
A Binary Image Classification project on the Caltech 101 dataset that uses OpenCV for feature extraction

Please see the pdf labeled ML_Final_Draft.pdf to understand the project results

All images are from the Caltech 101 image dataset, but they have been relabeled to 
identify whether they are natural or manmade. 

Python Files and Purpose:
parse.py - inital feature extraction
update.py - script to add additional features to feature space
